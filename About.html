 <h2>History of Horticulture</h2>

<font size="5">
The first known uses of horticulture date back to the ancient world, specifically 
in Egypt. As humans transitioned from a nomadic, hunting and gathering lifestyle 
to a semi-sedentary lifestyle, they began to build settlements in regions where 
water supplies were plentiful. Water is essential to human life just as it is to 
plant life. Historians suggest that ancient Egyptians borrowed techniques from 
other human settlements in the Middle East, but they cultivated the largest 
variety of plants by far. Over 200 species of plants were grown for consumption 
and appearance in ancient Egypt.
Horticulture is the science of cultivating plants for consumption or ornamental 
purposes. Landscaping is one of the leading purposes for horticulture practices.
