    Horticulture is the art of cultivating plants in gardens to produce food and 
medicinal ingredients, or for comfort and ornamental purposes. Horticulturists are 
agriculturists who grow flowers, fruits and nuts, vegetables and herbs, as well as 
ornamental trees and lawns.
The study and practice of horticulture have been traced back thousands of years. 
Horticulture contributed to the transition from nomadic human communities to 
sedentary, or semi-sedentary, horticultural communities.Horticulture is divided 
into several categories which focus on the cultivation and processing of different 
types of plants and food items for specific purposes.
